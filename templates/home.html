            <h2 class="h4 mb-3">Project Overview</h2>

            <p>
                This project is a full-stack machine learning application based on the Titanic dataset.
                The goal is to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on passenger information.
            </p>

            <p>The project covers the complete machine learning workflow:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Data exploration and preprocessing</li>
                <li>Feature engineering</li>
                <li>Model training and evaluation</li>
                <li>Deployment of the model in a Django web application</li>
                <li>Database persistence of predictions</li>
                <li>Collaborative development using Git and Scrum practices</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how a machine learning model can be integrated into 
                a full-stack web application. The focus is not only on model performance, but also on data processing, 
                system design, and presenting predictions through a user-friendly interface.

            <h2 class="h4 mb-3">Tech stack</h2>
            <p>
                Our tech stack is Python 3.12 for ML and backend, Django 5 for the web app,
                pandas and scikit-learn for data processing and modeling, SQLite for storing predictions,
                and Git/GitHub for collaboration, with VS Code as our development environment.

            <h2 class="h4 mb-3">Overview of the system architecture</h2>
            <p>The system follows a simple full-stack architecture that connects a machine learning workflow with a web application.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h3 class="h5 mb-3">Front-end (Django templates & Bootstrap)</h3>
                    <p>Users interact with the application through HTML forms styled with Bootstrap. 
                        The prediction form collects passenger information such as class, age, sex, fare, and embarkation port.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3 class="h5 mb-3">Back-end (Django views & forms)</h3>
                    <p>Django handles form validation, feature engineering, and application logic. After the form is submitted, 
                        the backend prepares the input data for the machine learning model.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3 class="h5 mb-3">Machine learning (pandas & scikit-learn)</h3>
                    <p>A trained machine learning model is used to predict survival probability based on the processed input features.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3 class="h5 mb-3">Database (SQLite)</h3>
                    <p>Each prediction, along with the input features and model output, is stored in a SQLite database. 
                        This allows predictions to be reviewed later on the History page.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3 class="h5 mb-3">Results and history pages</h3>
                    <p>The prediction result is shown immediately after submission and all past predictions can be viewed in a dedicated history view.</p>
