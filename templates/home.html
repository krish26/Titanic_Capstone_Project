            <h2 class="h4 mb-3">Project Overview</h2>

            <p>
                This project is a full-stack machine learning application based on the Titanic dataset.
                The goal is to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on passenger information.
            </p>

            <p>The project covers the complete machine learning workflow:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Data exploration and preprocessing</li>
                <li>Feature engineering</li>
                <li>Model training and evaluation</li>
                <li>Deployment of the model in a Django web application</li>
                <li>Database persistence of predictions</li>
                <li>Collaborative development using Git and Scrum practices</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how a machine learning model can be integrated into 
                a full-stack web application. The focus is not only on model performance, but also on data processing, 
                system design, and presenting predictions through a user-friendly interface.

                The project uses the Titanic dataset provided by Kaggle:

            <h2 class="h4 mb-3">Description of the machine learning model</h2>
            <p>This project uses supervised machine learning models to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster. 
                The target variable is Survived, which is a binary classification problem (survived or not survived).
            </p>

            <h3 class="h5 mb-3">Data preparation</h3>
            <p>Before training the models, the dataset was preprocessed as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Unused or non-informative columns such as PassengerId, Name, Ticket, and Cabin were removed.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Missing values were handled during preprocessing.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Categorical features such as AgeGroup and FareGroup were converted into numerical format using one-hot encoding.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The dataset was split into training and testing sets using an 80/20 split.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="h5 mb-3">Logistic Regression</h3>
            <p>A Logistic Regression model was trained as a baseline classifier.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Logistic Regression is a simple and interpretable model commonly used for binary classification tasks.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The model was trained using scikit-learn's LogisticRegression with an increased maximum number of iterations to ensure convergence.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Model performance was evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Logistic Regression model achieved an accuracy of approximately <strong>81,6%</strong> on the test set, providing a strong and interpretable baseline.</p>

            <h3 class="h5 mb-3">Random Forest</h3>
            <p>A Random Forest classifier was also trained to capture more complex patterns in the data.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Random Forest is an ensemble model that combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy and reduce overfitting.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>The model was trained with tuned hyperparameters such as the number of trees, tree depth, and minimum samples per split.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Model performance was evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Random Forest model achieved an accuracy of approximately <strong>82,1%</strong>. While the accuracy was quite similar to Logistic Regression, Random Forest demonstrated better flexibility in modeling non-linear feature interactions.</p>

            <h3 class="h5 mb-3">Model selection</h3>
            <p>Both models were trained and evaluated to compare performance and interpretability:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Logistic Regression was used as a baseline model due to its simplicity and transparency.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Random Forest was selected as the final model due to its better predictive performance.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The trained model is saved and integrated into the Django web application to generate survival predictions based on user input.</p>

            <h2 class="h4 mb-3">Overview of the system architecture</h2>
            <p>The system follows a simple full-stack architecture that connects a machine learning workflow with a web application.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h3 class="h5 mb-3">Front-end (Django templates & Bootstrap)</h3>
                    <p>Users interact with the application through HTML forms styled with Bootstrap. 
                        The prediction form collects passenger information such as class, age, sex, fare, and embarkation port.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3 class="h5 mb-3">Back-end (Django views & forms)</h3>
                    <p>Django handles form validation, feature engineering, and application logic. After the form is submitted, 
                        the backend prepares the input data for the machine learning model.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3 class="h5 mb-3">Machine learning (pandas & scikit-learn)</h3>
                    <p>A trained machine learning model is used to predict survival probability based on the processed input features.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3 class="h5 mb-3">Database (SQLite)</h3>
                    <p>Each prediction, along with the input features and model output, is stored in a SQLite database. 
                        This allows predictions to be reviewed later on the History page.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3 class="h5 mb-3">Results and history pages</h3>
                    <p>The prediction result is shown immediately after submission and all past predictions can be viewed in a dedicated history view.</p>
